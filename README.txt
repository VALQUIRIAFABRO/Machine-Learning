1. Machine-Learning
An example of PIPELINE FOR MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI). The core of ML is in teaching computers how to learn and make predictions from data without necessarily being programmed. (https://medium.com/)

Machine learning Pipeline
A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow to produce a machine learning model. Here will be shown a Pipeline to automate a machine learning model: Get data, clean, prepare, Train the model, test the model and improve.

Prediction: Analyze the dataset and predict whether the income of an adult will exceed 50k per year or not.

Dataset: used the Adult Salary Dataset available in UCI Machine Learning Repo or Kaggle.

2. GenAI Insights
Leverage Generative AI to generate insights, make predictions, and present data patterns in a way that is easy for stakeholders to understand. This approach is an example of how to help in making data-driven decisions and improving business strategies.

First some context:
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.
It's like having a creative assistant that can generate ideas, explore possibilities, and even fill in missing information. Â  

Some Examples of Purpose and Uses for Analysis:

Predictive Modeling and Simulation: By learning from historical data, generative AI can predict future outcomes, such as sales trends or customer behavior. It can simulate different scenarios to help businesses prepare for potential risks and opportunities.
Anomaly Detection and Fraud Prevention: Generative AI can identify unusual patterns or anomalies in data that may indicate fraudulent activity.
Personalized Insights and Recommendations: It can group customers based on their behavior and preferences, allowing for targeted marketing campaigns. It can suggest products or services that customers are likely to be interested in.
