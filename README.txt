An example of PIPELINE FOR MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI). The core of ML is in teaching computers how to learn and make predictions from data without necessarily being programmed. (https://medium.com/)

Machine learning Pipeline
A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow to produce a machine learning model. Here will be shown a Pipeline to automate a machine learning model: Get data, clean, prepare, Train the model, test the model and improve.

Prediction: Analyze the dataset and predict whether the income of an adult will exceed 50k per year or not.

Dataset: used the Adult Salary Dataset available in UCI Machine Learning Repo or Kaggle.
